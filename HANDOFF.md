# Handoff — 18 August 2026

Read `CLAUDE.md` first. This file is the current state and the open work.

**This describes commit `348e6559`** (PR #91, merged — the tip of `main`). Diff
against it rather than trusting anything below — a later session should
re-derive, not remember. Name a commit `main` actually pointed at: the licence
fix `37d12f50` is a branch commit that only ever reached `main` inside that
merge, so diffing against it walks through a state `main` never had.

## Every figure here is a command, not a number

A remembered figure survives a session boundary as a fact. A command survives as
a fact-checker. Nothing in this file states a count that you cannot regenerate,
because the counts move and this file will not.

```bash
./build.sh                      # must exit 0
python3 scripts/check.py        # page count, and every link/chrome/ceiling rule
python3 scripts/gate_selftest.py  # the propagation gate still catches its faults
node scripts/toolsmoke.js       # every tool runs; every served bundle parses
```

| What you want to know | How to get it |
|---|---|
| How many pages ship | `python3 scripts/check.py` prints `checked N pages` |
| How many tools are registered | `python3 -c "import sys;sys.path.insert(0,'_build');from _partials import TOOLS;print(len(TOOLS))"` |
| Which tools | same import, `[t['slug'] for t in TOOLS]` |
| Every prose ceiling | `assets/prose-budget.json` — and `scripts/gate.py`'s `page_words` is the only correct way to measure against it |
| A page's current weight | `python3 -c "import sys;sys.path.insert(0,'scripts');from gate import page_words;print(page_words('public/index.html','index.html'))"` |
| The planner's catalogue counts | `assets/50-upgrades.json` — `counts`, `standing`, `purge` |
| When the planner snapshot was read | `assets/50-upgrades.json` → `read` |
| Which zones are revamped | `assets/zones-index.json` → any zone with `revamped` |
| How many zones have cleared every gate | `python3 -c "import json,collections;print(collections.Counter(z['verify_level'] for z in json.load(open('assets/zones-index.json',encoding='utf-8'))))"` |
| Which pages lack the shared footer | `grep -rL site-foot --include='*.html' --exclude-dir=app public/` — the imported pages, and nothing else. Do **not** use `public/**/*.html`: with globstar off it silently skips the five root pages |
| What the Sky Ledger serves | `assets/sky-ledger.json` → `app.file`, `app.hash` |
| Measured sessions, zones, raid fights | `assets/measured.json`, `assets/raids-measured.json` |

**The rule behind the table:** where a decision can live in a data file or a
check, put it there. `zones-index.json` carrying the revamp date rather than two
generators is why that fact will outlive every session that reads this. It is
`gate.py`'s argument applied to sessions instead of pages.

## Do not build these

Every one has been considered and declined. A session arriving with energy and
no context will do them enthusiastically. Written down they are decisions;
unwritten they read as omissions.

| Not this | Why |
|---|---|
| Hosting the 50 Upgrades planner under `public/app/` | It is built, tested and refreshed in its own repository. We carry a description page and a link. Same-origin hosting makes us responsible for a release cadence we do not control. |
| A home-page feature band for 50 Upgrades | `index.html` has no room. The ceiling is in `prose-budget.json`, the gate fails at cap + 40, and the Sky Ledger band alone is ~190 words. The tools door already reads its count from `len(TOOLS)`, so the tool is announced at zero word cost. |
| Withdrawing any existing tool | Nothing currently duplicates anything. The Sky Ledger withdrawal on 17 Aug was justified by a correctness property ours lacked; absent that, two tools are two tools. |
| A shared `.btn` class | The imported pages carry their own stylesheets and never load `site.css`. A shared button would have to be injected into every one of them, and each already styles its own. Count them, never quote a number: `grep -rL site-foot --include='*.html' --exclude-dir=app public/`. Real, and post-launch. |
| The doubled `cache-control` header | Real, harmless, post-launch. |
| `.html` → extensionless 307 | Real, post-launch. It touches every internal link and the sitemap. |
| Self-hosting the site's fonts | Real, post-launch. |
| The map export | Post-launch. |
| Editing `public/assets/site.css` casually | It re-hashes `CSS_V` and rewrites the stylesheet line on every page. Fine when the CSS genuinely changed; never as a side effect. |
| Running `scripts/prose_budget.py` to fix a page that is over | It only lowers ceilings. A page over its cap is trimmed, or the ceiling is raised **by hand with the reason in the commit** — `CLAUDE.md` §5, precedent in PR #89. |

## For the session working on the planner

Two facts you cannot see from that repository:

**The Mistmoore revamp date is data, not code.** It lives in
`assets/zones-index.json` as `revamped` and `revamped_note` on the mistmoore
entry, and both `_build/build9.py` (the survey's measured section) and
`_build/build11.py` (the difficulty explainer) read it. When post-revamp logs
land, the ingestion path is a data edit and a rebuild — no generator changes.

**The licence correction is ours too.** `eqlwiki.com` publishes no content
licence: `siteinfo` `rightsinfo` is empty and `Project:Copyrights` is absent,
checked 18 August 2026. Any Sources screen carrying `used under CC BY-SA 4.0`
for eqlwiki-derived data is repeating an unsourced claim. Keep the attribution,
drop the terms, say the source states none.

## Recent shape of the work

The site was made **generic rather than personal** on 17 August: no character
names, kill counts, play dates or experience-per-kill anywhere a reader sees.
`CLAUDE.md` §7 is the rule and carries its three deliberate exemptions. A tier M
badge means "verified in play" — a page never has to publish the log to earn it.

**Tier C was withdrawn** the same day. It was generalised from a single event,
and one event is not a rank on a scale. The change log records both its
introduction and its withdrawal, because a ledger records what was true when it
was written.

The Castle Mistmoore survey is the house format; the other twelve and the raid
pages follow it. If you reformat anything, **diff for lost facts before you
commit** — a reformat deleted evidence on 17 August and a green build did not
notice. `scripts/check.py` validates that pages are well-formed, and `gate.py`
validates that figures agree with their data. Neither notices a sentence
describing a thing that no longer exists.
